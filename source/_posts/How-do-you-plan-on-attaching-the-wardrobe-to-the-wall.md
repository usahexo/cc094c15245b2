#  How do you plan on attaching the wardrobe to the wall?

Assuming you have a wall with sturdy studs that can support the weight of a wardrobe, one option for attaching it is to use screws or nails directly into the studs. You can find the approximate location of the studs by using a stud finder or by knocking on the wall and listening for a different sound in certain areas. Once you know where the studs are, you can mark them on the wall and use a level to make sure each shelf is straight.

Another option for attaching the wardrobe to the wall is to use brackets or anchors. Brackets can be attached to the wall first, and then the wardrobe can be hung from them. Anchors are designed to be inserted into wall plugs and then tightened, which will hold the weight of the wardrobe without having to puncture or damage the walls.

Whichever method you choose, make sure that you follow all safety instructions provided by the manufacturer and that you use appropriate hardware for your specific situation.

#  What type of flooring will you have in front of the wardrobe?

The flooring in front of the wardrobe should be chosen carefully. You will want a type of flooring that is durable and can handle being walked on often. Here are some types of flooring you can choose from:

1. Hardwood Flooring: Wood is a popular choice for flooring because it is both beautiful and durable. If you choose to have hardwood flooring in front of your wardrobe, make sure to keep it well-maintained, as it can scratch easily.

2. Laminate Flooring: Laminate flooring is a good option if you want the look of wood flooring but don't want to pay the price tag. Laminate flooring is also more durable than hardwood flooring, making it a good option for areas that are frequently walked on.

3. Ceramic Tile Flooring: Ceramic tile is apopular choice for bathrooms and kitchens because it is both water and stain resistant. It can also be difficult to scratch or stain, making it a good choice for in front of the wardrobe.

#  How often do you think you will use the sliding doors?

In some cases, the sliding door is only used once, while in other cases it can be used more often. It really depends on the person and their needs.

#  Are there any other features you would like the wardrobe to have?

If you're thinking about getting a wardrobe, there are a few factors you'll need to take into account. The first is size - make sure to measure the available space and choose a design that fits. You'll also need to decide on the style of wardrobe you want, and whether you want it to have any special features.

If you're looking for some extra storage space, consider getting a wardrobe with shelves or drawers. Alternatively, if you often struggle to find anything in your current wardrobe, consider getting one with mirrored doors - this will help you see what's inside without having to open the door.

Finally, think about what colour you want your wardrobe to be. This can be an important factor if you want it to match the rest of your bedroom décor.

#  How much space do you have available for the wardrobe?

When it comes to outfitting a new wardrobe, a common question people ask is “How much space do you have available for the wardrobe?” This consideration is important because it will help you determine the size and type of wardrobe you need.

If you have a small bedroom, you may want to consider a freestanding wardrobe that won’t take up too much floor space. On the other hand, if you have a large bedroom, you may want to invest in a built-in wardrobe that will make use of all the available space.

# What type of wardrobe should you choose?

Another factor to consider when outfitting your wardrobe is the type of wardrobe you should choose. There are three main types of wardrobes: freestanding, built-in, and sliding door.

Freestanding wardrobes are an excellent option if you have limited space because they can be placed anywhere in the room. However, they typically don’t offer as much storage space as built-in wardrobes. Built-in wardrobes are perfect for larger bedrooms as they make use of all the available space. Sliding door wardrobes are a good option if you want easy access to your clothes but don’t have a lot of floor space.

# What features should your wardrobe have?

When choosing a wardrobe, it’s important to think about the features you want it to have. Some features to consider include drawers, shelves, robes hooks, and shoe racks.

Drawers are ideal for storing smaller items such as underwear and socks. Shelves are perfect for storing larger items such as shirts and pants. Robes hooks are great for hanging robes and jackets while shoe racks can be used to store shoes or other accessories.

# How do you know how much storage space you need?

When calculating how much storage space you need in your wardrobe, it’s important to think about what type of clothing you own and how much space each item requires. For example, a shirt typically takes up less space than a pair of jeans.


  So, when calculating how much storage space you need, allow for around 10-12 inches of vertical storage per item of clothing. This will give you an idea of how much storage space your wardrobe needs overall.
